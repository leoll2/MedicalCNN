# MedicalCNN

This project aims to perform **abnormality classification** in mammography by means of **Convolutional Neural Networks**. The dataset of interest is the **CBIS DDSM** dataset. The mammogram images feature two kinds of breast abnormalities: mass and calcification, which can be either benign or malignant.  
The classification task consists in distinguishing between the four cases:

- Benign mass
- Malignant mass
- Benign calcification
- Malignant calcification

The full report is available [**here**](https://github.com/leoll2/MedicalCNN/blob/master/report.pdf).

## Experiments

[TODO]

## Tools

The project was developed using the following technologies:
- **Python**: scripting language
- **Keras**: open-source library for experimentation with deep neural networks
- **Google Colab**: free cloud-based Jupyter notebook environment by Google


## About the dataset

The dataset of interest is the **CBIS DDSM** *(Curated Breast Imaging Subset of Digital Database for Screening Mammography)*, a collection of mammography images by Lee et al. It is an updated version of the original DDSM dataset, where all the images have been segmented and labeled.
